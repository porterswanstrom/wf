This project contains a bunch of WinForms that I've made
while in college. None of these are complex, but a few
notable programs are:

chess_monitor
  This program lets a user move/take pieces on a chess board
  and save/load the state of the chess board via a save file.
  There are 3 boards the user can switch between in case
  multiple games need monitored simultaneously

txt_to_html
  A very basic text to HTML converter that only supports
  paragraphs, headers, and non-inline links
